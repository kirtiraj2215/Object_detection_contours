# Real-Time Color Detection and Contour Analysis

This project demonstrates real-time color detection and contour analysis using OpenCV. The application captures video from a webcam and provides a user interface to dynamically adjust the color thresholds for HSV color space. It then processes the video feed to highlight contours and their convex hulls.

## Features

- Real-time video capture from the webcam
- HSV color space conversion for color-based filtering
- Dynamic adjustment of color thresholds using trackbars
- Contour detection and convex hull drawing
- Display of processed images including mask, threshold, and detected contours

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
