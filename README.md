# Object_detection_contours
This project involves real-time color detection and contour analysis using OpenCV. The code captures video from a webcam, applies HSV color space transformation, and allows for dynamic adjustments of color thresholds through trackbars. It highlights contours and their convex hulls in the video feed.
